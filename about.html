      <div class="about-description">
        <p>
          I initially started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript sometime back.
          As I had no degree in this field, I had to depend on Udemy online
          classes for the same. I am from Customer Service background. I have
          about 10 years of experience in that field working for some of the
          most renowned MNCs in the world. I have worked for Convergys, Wipro,
          IBM DAKSH, American Express to name a few. I have experience in
          serving the USA and UK based customers in the past.
        </p>

          March, 2020 - Covid-19 took the world by surprise and everyone was
          confined to their homes. I got some time to think about my career
          choices and what profession would I want to go for in my life. I
          wanted to get into a field that is challenging, ever evolving and that
          which gives me something to always look forward to. That is when I
          realized that I should go for IT field.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey started then and there, I used Youtube to learn about
          computers and how they work. I also started learning about how to
          design something for the screen. I started using Figma to design
          different UIs. As I kept advancing my knowledge in this domain, I kept
          my pace with HTML, CSS and JavaScriipt as well. I remembered that I
          used to write small programs in GWBasic in school and also C++ with
          the help of my friend while I was in Delhi.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also started learning python to enhance my programming skills. I
          learnt little bit of Django as well but had to stop that because I got
          into an IT company called CallHub. I wanted to go for the role of
          front-end developer but they had opening for Automation QA Engineer .
          So, I decided to go ahead with that role as it required coding in
          python using Pytest-Selenium libraries. I got to automate the
          regression test cases for their products. I also got to learn tools
          like - Jira, GitHub, SauceLab, TestRail, TestProject automation tool,
          etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had to part my ways with CallHub as I was interested in front-end
          role to practice my skills on a real project. Currently I am learning
          React JS and have basic understanding of it. I am also developing my
          debugging skills using network tab, console log, etc. So, now I am
          looking forward to working with good companies that can provide me
          such an opportunity.
