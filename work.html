            This was my very first project. I used pure HTML and CSS to design
            and render this. It uses navbar, different hover effect, basic html,
            sidebar, footer, etc. Clicking on different links takes you to
            different pages as well.

            cards, etc. Bootstrap is very useful in situations where someone
            wants to design and render quickly.

            This is another JS game project. I makes use of JS DOM manipulation

            correctly and get a highscore when the player guesses correctly in
            the minimum number of attempts.
